# Configuration

This section provides you with a comprehensive overview of the diverse configuration and customization options available to help you optimally adapt the Expander Card to your needs.

## Configuration Overview

The Expander Card offers a wide range of configuration options that allow you to customize every aspect of the card. From basic settings like the title and initial state to advanced options such as custom animations, styling adjustments, and conditional displays.

Configuration is primarily done through YAML and can be applied individually per card. This allows you to use different Expander Cards with different settings on the same dashboard.

Key configuration areas include:

- **Basic Properties**: Title, icons, expansion states
- **Behavior**: Default state (expanded/collapsed), animations, gap settings
- **Styling**: Colors, fonts, spacing, backgrounds
- **Advanced Options**: Templating, conditional displays, button functions
- **Card Management**: Managing child cards within the expander

For a detailed overview of all available configuration options and their usage, please visit the [Configuration Overview](configuration-overview.md).

## Graphical Config Editor

To simplify configuration, the Expander Card provides a graphical configuration editor directly within the Home Assistant user interface. This editor allows you to make settings visually without having to manually edit YAML.

With the graphical editor, you can:

- **Configure Visually**: Change settings through user-friendly forms and dropdown menus
- **Live Preview**: See your changes in real-time as you configure the card
- **Validation**: Get immediate feedback on invalid settings
- **Easy Navigation**: Switch between different configuration sections using tabs
- **Code View**: Switch to YAML view when needed for advanced customizations

The graphical editor is particularly useful for beginners or when you want to make quick adjustments without needing to know the YAML syntax in detail.

For detailed information on using the graphical editor, see the [Graphical Configuration Editor Guide](gui-configuration.md).
